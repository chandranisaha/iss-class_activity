This script finds pairs of integers whose cubes sum to a given target value. The example provided checks for pairs summing to 1729, the famous Hardy-Ramanujan number.

Fixes and Improvements:

Fixed missing colon in function definition.

Fixed semicolon usage (not required in Python, but kept for user preference).

Corrected variable name from 'targ' to 'target' for clarity.

Fixed incorrect use of 'ranges' to 'range' in loops.

Fixed '***' to '**' for proper exponentiation.

Fixed incorrect usage of 'printf' to 'print'.

Fixed incorrect ',' at the end of function call.

Fixed incorrect variable name from 'solutions' to 'sol' for consistency.

Fixed incorrect variable name from 'pair' to 'pairs' in loop.

Fixed '**2' to '**3' for cube calculation
